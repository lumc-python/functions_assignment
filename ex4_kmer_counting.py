Exercise 6: k-mer counting

1. Remember the previous exercise of finding unique substrings of length 3?
  - Make a function from your implementation that, given a sequence, it returns
    a set with the unique substrings.
  - Make `k` as a default argument to the function.
  - Add a docstring to the function.

2. Make another function with the same arguments (`sequence` and `k`) that uses
   a dictionary in the implementation with substring counts.
  - Use the substrings as dictionary keys.
  - Use the counts as dictionary values.
  - Have the function return the dictionary.
  - Add a docstring to the function.
