Exercise 3: Palindrome
==========

Write a function that returns `True` if its argument is a palindrome and
`False` otherwise. A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence
of characters which reads the same way backward as forward (e.g., `madam`,
`able was i ere i saw elba`, `10101`, `90.09`).
