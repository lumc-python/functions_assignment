# 1. Multiplication

Write a Python function to multiply all the positive numbers in a list.
The function should return that result.

# 2. Function updates

Write a python function that transforms all the positive numbers from a list
and returns back `True` if it performed any action on the list and `False`
otherwise.

# 3. Palindrome

Write a function that returns `True` if its argument is a palindrome and
`False` otherwise. A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence
of characters which reads the same way backward as forward (e.g., `madam`, 
`able was i ere i saw Elba`, `10101`, `90.09`).

# 4. k-mer counting

## 1. Remember "Exercise 3" (Analyse a repeat structure) from yesterday's assignment?
 
- Make a function from your implementation that, given a sequence, it returns
  a set with the unique substrings.
- Make `k` as a default argument to the function.
- Add a docstring to the function.

## 2. Make another function with the same arguments (`sequence` and `k`) that uses
a dictionary in the implementation with substring counts.

- Use the substrings as dictionary keys.
- Use the counts as dictionary values.
- Have the function return the dictionary.
- Add a docstring to the function.
